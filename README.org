* Welcome to my emacs.d repository

Honestly, I can't help feeling that my Emacs is great. Here are some
of the highlights.

** elshogi

Watching professional [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi][shogi]] games live is of great fun.

You can also play against engines of course.

** org-ytdl

Auto generate previews when org-capturing videos.

Also note the graphical system monitors on the bottom right.

** recentb

Extend the concept of file history so that it encompasses eww, elfeed,
info, man, you name it.

And yes, they are persistent.
